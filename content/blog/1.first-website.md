Hey!\
\
First blog posted here, hopefully not the last one xD\
\
First things first, i'm Creeperkatze. A Unity game Developer looking into some other aspects of programming, like web developement.\
\
I always enjoyed creating responsive UI's for my unity games, but at first didn't really know on how to get started with web developement, as I didn't know what tools to use. At least I was smart enough to not go with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript :0\
\
I originally started using Nuxt out of curiosity, as I found GitHub's native jekyll pages limiting, at least on the surface. I also tried out Next.js, but wasn't really impressed... Maybe because I haven't used React yet.\
Long story short: This is my shot at creating a personal portfolio-ish website, while trying out some cool stuff with theming! ^_^\
\
Of course the website is still in early developement, so expect drastic updates over time.\

Be sure to check out the [GithHub repo](https://github.com/creeperkatze/creeperkatze.github.io) for this site if you're interested on how I implemented some things.
