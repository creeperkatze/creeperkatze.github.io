This website uses Google AdSense, a service provided by Google LLC, to display ads.
Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s previous visits to this or other websites.

## Data Collection

We do not directly collect personally identifiable information from visitors. However, third-party vendors, including Google, may collect information (such as IP address, browser type, or interests) through cookies or other technologies for the purpose of showing relevant ads.

<br>

## Managing Cookies and Consent
<br>

You can control how cookies are used via our cookie/consent banner (powered by Google CMP) and through your browser settings. If you decline cookies, you may still see ads, but they may be less relevant.
